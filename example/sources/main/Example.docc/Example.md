# ``Example``

An example app to test the OAuth2 client with several providers.

## Overview

To test the OAuth client I tried several OAuth2 providers. However, this requires creating an 
account and registering an application with them. Youâ€™ll need to do this yourself. Follow the 
instructions for the provider of your choosing:

- <doc:Tumblr>

Once you configure at least one, you can start the application and access your account.
