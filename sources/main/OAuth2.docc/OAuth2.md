### Understanding OAuth2

This section explains OAuth2 in progressive detail.

OAuth (**O**pen **Auth**orization) is an open standard for authorizing applications to access 
protected resources on behalf of the user. There are two OAuth standards in use: 
 [OAuth 1.0a](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849) and 
 [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749).

Version 2 is a simplification of version 1. It replaces digital signatures with SSL/TLS 
communication. This makes it easier to implement and understand, but both standards are
safe and continue to be in use.
